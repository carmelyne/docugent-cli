# Docugent CLI (Alpha)

Docugent is a documentation-first CLI tool that scaffolds AI-readable project structure. It helps agents like Codex and Claude understand, build, and track tasks based on human-friendly, folder-aligned checklists.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g docugent
```

## ðŸ“¦ Scaffold a Project

Generate a `.docugent/` folder for your current project:

```bash
docugent scaffold core
```

You can also scaffold additional documentation:

```bash
docugent scaffold addons
docugent scaffold tech-seo
docugent scaffold changelog
```

## ðŸ§  How It Works

Docugent creates scoped documentation folders like:

```
.docugent/
  â”œâ”€ ux/
  â”œâ”€ mvc/
  â”œâ”€ db-schema/
  â”œâ”€ design-system/
  â”œâ”€ agent-instructions.md
```

These files help AI agents align with your projectâ€™s intent and follow a consistent build protocol.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Scaffolds folders like `ux/`, `mvc/`, `db-schema/`, `devops/`, and more
- Prevents overwriting existing `.md` files by default
- Supports `--force` and `--backup` for controlled overwrites
- Designed for use with tools like Codex CLI or Claude

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
# Scaffold core structure
docugent scaffold core

# Add devops structure (with backup protection)
docugent scaffold devops --force --backup

## ðŸ§ª Test the CLI

These commands are for contributors working on Docugent itself.

Run unit tests using Vitest:

```bash
npm run test
```

Watch test output live:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Note: This is for testing the CLI generatorâ€”not your `.docugent/` scaffolds.
```

Docugent is in active development and perfect for AI-assisted app flipping, scoped prototyping, and doc-driven dev.
