# Dokugent Principles

### 1. Listen to the Unheard

We don’t just collect feedback from the loudest voices—we pay attention to the overlooked, the silent friction, and the abandoned efforts. Real developer pain often hides in the things left undocumented, the tools duct-taped together, or the ideas never shipped. We build for those too.

### 2. Respect Ecosystems

Dokugent doesn’t compete with agent engines or orchestration frameworks. We generate clean, structured outputs that any runtime can adopt. Interoperability, not dominance.

### 3. Protocols are Thoughtful Agreements

A protocol isn’t a spec for machines—it’s a living agreement between humans and agents, made legible and auditable. We honor that by keeping protocols readable, certifiable, and intentional.

### 4. Actions Deserve Integrity

Steps and plans should be clear, executable, and testable. We make the bridge between “what we agreed” and “what we run.” That’s the job of a good compiler.

### 5. Humane by Default

Dokugent isn’t optimized for scale first—it’s optimized for clarity, trust, and sanity. Agents shouldn’t just work—they should make sense.

### 6. Build with Kindness, Ship with Teeth

We’re empathetic in design, but blunt when necessary. Code is reviewed. Plans are certified. Trust is earned.

### 7. Make It Feel Obvious (Later)

Good tools don’t feel flashy—they feel inevitable in hindsight. We aim for features that feel like they’ve always belonged in the dev workflow.

### 8. Everyone Is a Developer

Dokugent is built on the belief that development is a way of thinking, not a job title. Whether you're a researcher, educator, civic planner, or curious thinker—if you're designing a repeatable structure and executing ideas, you're a dev. Dokugent adapts to how you think and work, not the other way around.
