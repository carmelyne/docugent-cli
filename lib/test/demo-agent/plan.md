# Plan: Weather Dashboard Agent

## Goal

Retrieve current weather data for a specified city and update a Markdown-based dashboard file with the results.

## Steps

1. Parse input to extract the city name.
2. Call the weather API using the provided API key.
3. Format the response data (temperature, conditions, etc.).
4. Open `dashboard.md` and inject the formatted data under the "Current Weather" section.
5. Save the updated file and log the operation outcome.

## Notes

This plan assumes network access is available and the file `dashboard.md` exists in the working directory.
