# UX – User Flows

This file defines the main user flows an application should support. It is designed for agent-assisted app building, prototyping, or documentation. Checklists below are agent-readable and follow a predictable structure.

## 🔄 Request Ride

- [ ] User opens app
- [ ] User enters pickup and drop-off location
- [ ] User confirms ride request
- [ ] App matches user to a driver

## ❌ Cancel Ride

- [ ] User cancels before a match is made
- [ ] App notifies assigned driver (if applicable)

🧠 AI Note: These flows should be cross-referenced with `mvc/views.md` and `mvc/controllers.md` to map visual and backend behavior.
