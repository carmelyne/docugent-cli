# ðŸ§  Doku Tag Chaining Example

This example demonstrates how to chain multiple `@tags` in a single prompt to guide agents through complex, multi-step reasoning flows â€” without needing JSON, plugins, or wrappers.

## Example Prompt

```
@document_analysis:
Review the policy excerpt below and summarize key environmental goals.

@vector_search:
Compare the goals against known sustainability frameworks and surface alignment.

@text_generation:
Summarize findings into a 500-character message for a social media post.
```

## Why It Works

Each tag introduces a clear reasoning boundary:
- `@document_analysis` tells the LLM to break down input context.
- `@vector_search` prompts similarity checks or comparison logic.
- `@text_generation` produces human-friendly output.

## Tested On

âœ… ChatGPT
âœ… Codex
âœ… Claude
âœ… Gemini
âœ… Meta AI
âœ… DeepSeek

All models respected the tag order and completed each phase.

Doku Tags are like markdown headers â€” modular, readable, and chainable. Try writing your next prompt using `@tags` and see how your agents respond.
