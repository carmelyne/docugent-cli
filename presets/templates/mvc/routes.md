# MVC â€“ Routes

This file documents API endpoints and their purpose. Routes should map to controller logic and correspond with UI flows when applicable.

## ðŸš— Ride Routes

- [ ] `POST /rides` â€“ create a new ride request
- [ ] `GET /rides/:id` â€“ fetch details of a specific ride
- [ ] `PATCH /rides/:id/accept` â€“ assign a driver to the ride
- [ ] `PATCH /rides/:id/cancel` â€“ cancel a pending ride
- [ ] `PATCH /rides/:id/complete` â€“ mark a ride as completed

---

ðŸ§  AI Note: Each route should correspond to a method in `mvc/controllers.md`. Use this file to generate route handlers, route guards, and link endpoints to frontend state.
